# Annotations

Noir FV programs contain **specifications** to define the intended behavior of the code. These specifications include **preconditions**, **postconditions** and **assertions**. Specifications are one form of *ghost code* â€” code that appears in the Noir source code for verification purposes, but it is not included in the compiled executable.

This chapter covers the syntax and usage of these specifications through basic examples of preconditions, postconditions, and assertions.
