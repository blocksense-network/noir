# Limitations

As a prototype, Noir FV has certain limitations and does not yet support some features of Noir. The following features are currently unsupported:
* **Mutable references** as function parameters
* **Lambda functions**
* **Standard library functions**
* **Unconstrained functions**
* **Vectors** (`Vec<T>`)
* **Optional types** (`Option<T>`)

These limitations may change as Noir FV evolves.
