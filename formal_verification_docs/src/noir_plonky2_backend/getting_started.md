# Getting Started

## Installation

0. Install dependencies, you'll only need two things: the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download/) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html). They're compatible with most OSes and will **not** collide with your system.

    After installing `direnv` do not forget to [add the hook](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)!

1. Clone [our repository](https://github.com/blocksense-network/noir/) with SSH:

    ```bash copy
    git clone https://github.com/blocksense-network/noir.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder `noir`.

    ```bash copy
    cd noir
    ```

3. Run direnv command:

    ```bash copy
    direnv allow
    ```

    Depending on your `nix` installation, you may get a `Permission denied` error. In that case, it's best to start a superuser shell and continue from there:

    ```bash
    sudo su                      # Start superuser shell
    eval "$(direnv hook bash)"   # Setup the direnv hook
    direnv allow
    ```

    This should result in a plethora of things happening in the background and foreground. Sit back, relax, and wait it out. By the end you'll have everything ready to start work.

4. Test if everything works:

    ```bash copy
    cargo test zk_dungeon
    ```

    This will also take a little bit of time, until the project fully compiles.

## Using

We're now ready to create our first proof!

1. Create a new project:

    ```bash copy
    nargo new my_program
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder:

    ```bash copy
    cd my_program
    ```

3. Update the program with your favorite text editor to:

    ```rust copy filename="src/main.nr"
    fn main(x: pub u64, y: u64) {
        assert(x % y == 0);
    }
    ```

    This program allows one to prove that they know of a private factor `y` of a public integer `x`.

4. Run a small check to generate what you need:

    ```bash copy
    nargo check
    ```

5. We're almost there, change prove inputs to:

    ```toml copy filename="Prover.toml"
    x = "4611686014132420609"
    y = "2147483647"
    ```

6. Finally, we're ready to start proving:

    ```bash copy
    nargo prove
    ```

    Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you've made your first proof! Now we can verify it:

    ```bash copy
    nargo verify
    ```

You've now successfully written and proven a Noir program! Feel free to play around, for example, if you change `y` to `3` in `Prover.toml`, you'll get a prove error.

Once you're done, head over to [noir-lang.org](https://noir-lang.org/) and start learning about the language.
